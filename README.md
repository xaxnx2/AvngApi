## Problem

A local video game store wants to make a cashier app for their transactions. They don't have a membership system in place, just want to make the reporting easier by making the cashier into an application.

The order made in the app is already paid, there's no paylater system in the store. Also, one order can only store one game. If another order exist for a game, it'll be in a separate order. Order must note the employee that process the order. If an order is to be updated, it can only update quantity and price.

Features that they request:

- Manage games
- Manage orders
- Game Stock Report
- Developers' Games Report
- Order Report

## Solution

Create a Go CLI App that can handle all the request and limitations
